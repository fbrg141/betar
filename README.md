## BetAr - arbitrage detection
BetAr is  simple python script for detecting and calculating arbitrage opportunitiess.
Script expects data specified format in input.txt file which is in same directory as script.

This works as based purely on theory and it is for learning purpose, it is not meant to be used in practice. Gambling is risky and no one should do it. This is simply a code-based demonstration of the arbitrage betting formula for unsorted and unorganised data.
